When the VB command-line compiler reports errors, the line #s are as if you were editing in the VB editor.

This script translate Line #'s reported by vb command line to the actual source code line.

Simply type  <VBline#>gvb  or  :VGO <VBLine#>  
and you go to the corresponding line in the VB code.
